# Stable Diffusion 1.4 Fine-tuning with LoRA: Technical Details

This document outlines the technical aspects of the project and highlights the areas that need to be implemented.

## Project Structure

- `train_lora.py`: Main training script
- `dataset.py`: Custom dataset class for loading images
- `lora_diffusion.py`: LoRA implementation and integration with Stable Diffusion
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sd-lora-finetuning.git
   cd sd-lora-finetuning
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Technical Details and Implementation Requirements

### 1. LoRA Implementation (`lora_diffusion.py`)

The `lora_diffusion.py` file contains the core LoRA implementation. You need to:

a) Complete the `LoRALayer` class:
   - Implement proper initialization of LoRA matrices A and B
   - Ensure correct forward pass computation

b) Finish the `LoRANetwork` class:
   - Implement the logic to inject LoRA layers into the base model
   - Ensure proper forward pass that incorporates LoRA computations

c) Complete the `inject_trainable_lora` function:
   - Identify the layers in the Stable Diffusion U-Net that should be adapted (typically attention layers)
   - Replace or wrap these layers with LoRA layers
   - Ensure that only LoRA parameters are set to trainable

### 2. Training Script (`train_lora.py`)

The main training script needs the following implementations:

a) Training step:
   - Implement the forward pass through the model
   - Compute the loss (typically MSE between predicted and target noise)
   - Perform backpropagation and optimizer step

b) Logging and checkpointing:
   - Add logging of training progress (e.g., loss per epoch)
   - Implement periodic saving of model checkpoints

c) Evaluation:
   - Add functionality to generate images using the fine-tuned model
   - Implement evaluation metrics (e.g., FID score) if desired

### 3. Dataset Preparation (`dataset.py`)

The `CustomDataset` class is mostly implemented, but you may need to:

a) Add functionality for text captions if your dataset includes them
b) Implement additional data augmentation techniques if needed

### 4. Additional Considerations

- Implement gradient accumulation for effective training with larger batch sizes
- Add mixed precision training for improved performance
- Implement learning rate scheduling

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have completed the setup and installation steps above.
2. Prepare your dataset and update the `dataset_path` in `train_lora.py`
3. Complete the TODO items in the code files
4. Run the training script: `python train_lora.py`

## Customizing Dependencies

If you need to add or update dependencies:

1. Modify the `requirements.txt` file
2. Reinstall the requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
